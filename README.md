**IRON DOME**
A simple 2D game made with Unity, where the player must protect a city under heavy bombardment. The goal is to survive as long as possible and beat your previous high score. Buildings take damage and collapse gradually when hit by bombs. The game ends when all buildings are destroyed and the entire city lies in ruins. The main menu displays the player's best score and the number of days survived. The game over cinematic and pause screens both display the player's current score and the number of days survived during the session. The game features a dynamic day-night cycle, where nighttime increases the difficulty by making bombs harder to see, rewarding players with extra points for surviving and scoring during these more challenging periods.

The main menu displays options to play the game, navigate to the settings, see the credits or quit
