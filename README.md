**IRON DOME**
A simple 2D game made with Unity, where the player must protect a city under heavy bombardment. The goal is to survive as long as possible and beat your previous high score. Buildings take damage and collapse gradually when hit by bombs. The game ends when all buildings are destroyed and the entire city lies in ruins. The main menu displays the player's best score and the number of days survived. And of course, the spawn rate of the bombs gets faster over time. The game over cinematic and pause screens both display the player's current score and the number of days survived during the session. The game features a dynamic day-night cycle, where nighttime increases the difficulty by making bombs harder to see, rewarding players with extra points for surviving and scoring during these more challenging periods.

## Development
Development History
The game was originally developed using Unity 2020.3.21f, but was later upgraded to Unity 2021.3.45f due to build issues related to the advertisement system.

I began development in autumn 2022, building the game entirely on my own. During this initial phase, I implemented the core gameplay systems, including:
-Enemy spawning system
-City destruction
-Explosion animations
-Basic enemy types
-Score tracking system
-Main menu
-Game over screen 
-Pause screen 
-Core game view

At that time, the game featured only a night environment, and there was no cannon particle system (firing effects) implemented yet.

Development of the prototype took a few months, but due to ongoing work and studies, I was only able to continue development in spring 2025.

-In 2025, I resumed work on the game and added several major improvements:
-Implemented cannon firing effects with a particle system
-Added a full Day & Night cycle
-Created a dedicated Settings menu with adjustable options
-Designed new enemy types (e.g., bombs)
-Reworked the main menu
-Replaced all sound effects (except the soundtrack)
-Mastered the soundtrack using FL Studio
-Updated and improved graphics and visual assets
-Implemented ads
